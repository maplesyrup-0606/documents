&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;

&nbsp;     * There is no limit to how many steps you can take, but the score is
&nbsp;     * directly related to how long it takes you to find Kamino.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;

&nbsp;     * (2) Use method onKamino() to know if your ship is on Kamino.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * (3) Use method moveTo(int id) to move to a neighboring planet
&nbsp;     * with the given ID. Doing this will change state to reflect the
&nbsp;     * ship&#39;s new position.
